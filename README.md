Uncovering Novel Drug Target Interaction from Graph Structured Network Utilizing Graph Representation Learning

Drug Target Interactions (DTI) are essential in terms of accelerating drug discovery, personalized medicine and repurposing existing drugs. Previously this was done by methods that required severe labour and time. Recently machine learning (ML) is changing this scenario by narrowing down search space. The availability of significant amount of data regarding protein and drug features is making it possible. Most recently, algorithms for graph representation learning have beentrained to generate node embeddings from drug-target networks. These embeddings can be utilized for any downstream prediction like the existence of a link from drug node to target node with the help of trained ML models. In this study, a heterogeneous graph is created which has two types of nodes: drugs and targets and three types of edges: drug to drug, target to target and drug to target. These edges are being considered from the eleven types of drug-drug, target-target, and drug-target relationships. Inductive graph representation learning algorithm, GraphSAGE is applied to generate embeddings for both kinds of nodes from this heterogeneous graph. Then a classifier of a three-layer neural network is trained from these embeddings to predict the link from drug nodes to target nodes. Empirical analysis is provided
to evaluate the proposed methodology to predict DTIs.
